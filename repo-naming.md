# My Repository Naming Scheme
The rules are to be read from top to bottom.

## What is this?
On GitHub, when you visit a profile, their repository list is shown as a 
large block per repository (instead of a condensed list, like File Explorer), 
and there is no way people can categorise their repositories.

Without a naming scheme like this, I will very quickly get lost while scrolling 
through my repositories, and I would easily leave duplicate repositories behind, 
or in some cases, miss out on a repository that I needed to delete ages ago!

So without further ado, here's my rules to naming repositories.

---

## Websites
If the repository directly powers a website, the repository will be named 
as the domain/subdomain.  
Example: [ricoip.github.io](https://github.com/ricoip/ricoip.github.io)

*If the domain name has since been expired after the project's abandonment, 
the prefix rules below will apply, where the domain name is `ProjectName`.*

### Why no prefixes?
This is a special convention where your "root" GitHub Pages 
(i.e. [ricoip.github.io](https://github.com/ricoip/ricoip.github.io)) 
should be named as the domain name itself so that GitHub Pages 
can automatically kick in, without any tinkering with the Pages settings.

Since my website is like this already, I have applied this rule to every website 
I made for consistency.

## Formatting
If the repository is used for projects in school, they will be formatted as 
`School_[NameOfSchool]-[Form/Year/Activity]_[ProjectName]`.  
Example: "School_XXX-F6_FinalProj"

If the repository is used for personal projects, they will be formatted as 
`ricoip_[ProjectName]`.  
Example: [ricoip_WebDevCourse](https://github.com/ricoip/ricoip_WebDevCourse)

## Capitalisation
If the word itself is not a proper noun, the project name will follow 
Pascal case. (Camel case with the first letter also captialised)  
Example: [ricoip_WebDevCourse](https://github.com/ricoip/ricoip_WebDevCourse)

## Dialect
I normally write in both US and UK English, though I try to use UK English as 
much as possible.
